## Resubmission notes (addresses Submission 31f5c251)

- **Sign in with Apple (Guideline 2.1(a))** — On iOS this uses the **native Apple sheet**
  (`ASAuthorization` / Face ID / Touch ID), not a web page. Tap **"Continue with Apple"** on the
  sign-in screen; the native sheet appears and completes in-app with no Safari round-trip. Email and
  Google sign-in are also available; the demo account above signs in with email.
- **In-App Purchases (Guideline 2.1(b))** — All subscription and Trip Pass products are sold via
  **In-App Purchase (RevenueCat / StoreKit)** and are submitted for review **with this build**. To
  view them: sign in with the demo account → **Settings → Billing / Pro**. The paywall loads live
  StoreKit prices; no external (Stripe) checkout is reachable on iOS.

## Native Integrations

This app uses a WebView to deliver our web platform alongside the following native capabilities that require a native app:

1. **Terms & Privacy Agreement** — Before account creation, the app presents a native consent screen requiring users to agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy via a checkbox. This is persisted locally so returning users are never prompted again.

2. **Push Notifications (APNs)** — Users receive native push notifications for chat messages, trip updates, expense split requests, and calendar changes. After first launch, the app presents a pre-permission screen explaining notification value before requesting OS permission.

3. **AI Voice Concierge (Native Audio)** — The AI travel assistant uses native audio capture and playback (via expo-audio on iOS and expo-audio-stream on Android) for real-time voice conversations. This bypasses WKWebView's unreliable Web Audio API, providing low-latency 200ms audio chunks with gapless playback and barge-in support.

4. **Haptic Feedback** — Trip interactions (reactions, confirmations, navigation) trigger native haptic feedback for a tactile experience not possible in a browser.

5. **Native Share Sheet** — Users can share trip invites and media via the native iOS share sheet.

6. **Deep Linking / Universal Links** — Links to `chravel.app/trip/*`, `chravel.app/join/*`, etc. open directly in the app. The `chravel://` custom URL scheme is also supported.

7. **In-App Purchases (RevenueCat)** — Subscription tiers (Explorer, Frequent Chraveler) are managed through RevenueCat with native StoreKit integration.
